# EM-Wave-Through-5-Media
Extra credit project for Dr. Herczfeld's ECEE304 class. This code models the transmission of a given wave input (given as a set of frequencies) and shows the power loss and resulting waveform. The wave is converted to the discrete time domain using Matlab's inverse fourier transform function and passed through a coded in Smith Chart.
